This repository contains the python code for performing the numerical simulations about the inner representation matrix.\\
The code to be run is the one named 'inner_representation.py'. Details about how the computation is done can be found as comments inside this file.\\
The experiment are saved in the 'experiments' directory that has to be created before running the code.\\
This repository contains also downloaded real data such as MNIST and CIFAR10.
