Dynamical Levy Lattice
---

In this repository you can find the code used for creating the data, which were used in the paper "Critical dynamics of long range models on Dynamical LÃ©vy Lattices", currently submitted on PRB (APS). You can find a preprint version here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18057..\
In a nutshell we provide an algorithm which is able to generate configurations of a Long Range Ising Model, where the interaction decays with the distance following a power-law $r^{-(d+\sigma)}$. \
The repository is organized as follow:\
--> functions.py\
  Here you find all the functions that will be used in the main program.\
--> parameters.py\
   Here you can personalize the simulation with the wanted parameters (as temperature, dimension, sizes,...) and choose which prescription for the dynamics you want.\
--> main.py\
   This is the main program, the only one you have to run, after changing the parameters.\
--> main.ipynb\
   This is a Colab Notebook where all three programs mentioned before are present. Here you can see all the algorithm details in a more readability way.\
--> C++\
   In this folder you can find the same algorithm but in C++, both for 1D and 2D case. Here I implemented also a version with OMP, which allows you to run the code in parallel CPUs, in order to speed up simulations. On our machines, the C++ code seems faster than the Python one by a O(50) times in computational time, so I recommend you to use it! (But the Python code is more readable!) In this folder there is also a famous pseudorandom number generator the SFMT.\

 Please, feel free to use this code for you research or curiosity! \
